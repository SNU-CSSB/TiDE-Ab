# TiDE-Ab: De Novo Epitope-Specific Antibody Design via SE(3) Flow Matching
TiDE-Ab is a generative framework for the de novo design of therapeutic antibodies targeting specific epitopes. By leveraging Conditional SE(3) Flow Matching and a novel Time-Dependent Classifier-Free Guidance (TD-CFG) strategy, TiDE-Ab generates physically plausible antibody backbones and accurate global binding poses without relying on pre-aligned templates.

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: "De Novo Epitope-Specific Antibody Design via SE(3) Flow Matching with Time-Dependent Guidance"
